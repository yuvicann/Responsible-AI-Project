Loan Approval Prediction with Fairness Considerations ðŸš€
A Machine Learning-powered Loan Approval System with Bias Detection and Fairness Adjustments

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a loan approval prediction system that integrates fairness constraints to reduce biases in automated decision-making. It includes:
âœ… Bias detection in loan approvals
âœ… Fairness-aware machine learning models
âœ… Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
âœ… Interactive Streamlit app for loan predictions

ðŸŽ¯ Features
âœ… Bias-aware predictions using fairness constraints
âœ… Dynamic thresholding for approval decisions
âœ… Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) adjustment for risk assessment
âœ… Fairness metrics evaluation to detect biases
âœ… Interactive Streamlit App for real-time loan prediction

ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack
Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting)
Fairness Evaluation (Custom fairness thresholds)
Visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly)
Streamlit (Interactive UI)
GitHub (Version control & collaboration)
